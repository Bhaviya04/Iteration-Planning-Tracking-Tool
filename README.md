Estimating the effort, time, and resources needed to complete project activities is one of the most
challenging tasks that project managers must face. This is because of the inherent uncertainty
associated with many activities. Almost all the projects are unique. Uncertainty because the
activity is unique to the project or the activity is being accomplished by a resource that is not a
practiced expert or the interaction of this activity with other project activities is unique in this
project. All of these can create problems when estimating effort, time or resources. If the effort
needed to complete the scope is uncertain - for instance the number of hours of work needed to
complete an analysis - the time and resources needed will be uncertain. There are various tools
which are mainly used for estimating project activities. This document briefly describes about
the tools and techniques for estimation along with the examples. Before the project work begins,
you must make sure that the work is properly understood and agreed to by the project sponsor
and key stakeholders. You need to work with the sponsor and stakeholders to ensure that there
is a common perception of what the project will deliver, when it will be complete, what it will
cost, who will do the work, how the work will be done, and what the benefits will be. The larger
the project, the more important it is that this information be mapped out formally and explicitly.
All projects should start with this type of upfront planning to prevent problems caused by
differing viewpoints on the basic terms of the project. You should create an overall project work
plan before the project starts. This helps you estimate the total project effort and duration.
Without proper project planning, there will be poor estimates, poor scope control and lack of
business support. Project managers must use some effective project planning tools in order to
make sure the project flow is maintained. This document explains about the tools for planning
along with some instances. Along with the tools and techniques of Planning and Estimation, this
document shows the importance of BA Tool which is a software created for effective planning
and estimation.
